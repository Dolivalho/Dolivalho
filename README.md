### Front-end Developer, passionate about crafting user-centric solutions for Industry 4.0. I excel in building dynamic interfaces with React.js and TypeScript, while also delivering Full Stack applications using Python and MySQL. 
With hands-on experience in IoT (RFID) and MQTT, Iâ€™ve developed production-ready systemsâ€”like a logistics asset management toolâ€”that reduced aircraft assembly time and enhanced operational efficiency. 
I thrive in agile environments (Scrum), analyzing requirements and automating KPIs to bridge teams and tech. Committed to continuous learning, Iâ€™m driven to create impactful, scalable software.
